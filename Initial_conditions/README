Script to regrid initial conditions between SE and SE regional refined resolutions

```
ncl regrid_all_spectral_data.ncl
```

Atmospheric initial condition for regional refined grids have to often be created from a spun up lower resolution model simulations and then need to be regridded. We provide an ncl script that allows to regrid from the standard spectral element 1 degree resolution to the new grid.

To run with CESM, the file has to be then converted to a cdf5 format
```
nccopy -k cdf5 oldfile newfile
```
