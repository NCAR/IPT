These scripts regrid meteorological reanalysis datasets (e.g., MERRA2) to the model
resolution (horizontal and vertical) for use in the "physics-side nudging" scheme in CESM2.
Further details are provided on the MUSICA wiki page
(https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/MUSICA/Regridding+meteorological+data).

The processing scripts are slightly different for the two available dycores, so they are 
contained in separate directories in the IPT repository. In each, there is a README that 
provides general guidance for setting the script variables for a desired reanalysis product.
