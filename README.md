Input Processing Tools for MUSICA

Detailed discussion will be provided on the MUSICA wiki. [https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/MUSICA/MUSICA+Home]

This collection of scripts and code are for the production of input fields that are required to run MUSICA-V0.  They target emissions, meterological reanalyses for nudging, and initial conditions.

These scripts will not be advanced or maintained due to the fact that MUSICA will soon provide infrastructure to do the regridding online as part of the model.  This scripts are provided to the community now so that they can use MUSICA-V0


## Emissions gridding toools

Gridding FINN (Fire INventory from NCAR) biomass burning emissions: Emissions/Fire/FINN

Regridding CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) anthropogenic emissions: Emissions/CAMS_Anthropogenic

Regridding CMIP6 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project) historical anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions: Emissions/CMIP

Gridding US EPA NEI (National Emissions Inventory) emissions: Emissions/EPA_Anthropgenic


## Meteorological Data Regridding

Regrid MERRA2 meteorological reanalyses: Meterological_Reanalysis_Data


## Initial Conditions Regridding

Regrid atmospheric initial condition files: Initial_conditions
