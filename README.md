Input Processing Tools for MUSICA

Detailed discussion will be provided on the MUSICA wiki. [https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/MUSICA/MUSICA+Home]

This collection of scripts and code are for the production of input fields that are required to run MUSICA-V0.  They target emissions, meterological reanalyses for nudging, and initial conditions.


## Emissions gridding toools

Gridding FINN (Fire INventory from NCAR) biomass burning emissions: https://github.com/NCAR/IPT/tree/master/Emissions/Fire/FINN

Regridding CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) anthropogenic emissions: https://github.com/NCAR/IPT/tree/master/Emissions/CAMS_Anthropogenic

Regridding CMIP6 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project) historical anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions: https://github.com/NCAR/IPT/tree/master/Emissions/CMIP

Gridding US EPA NEI (National Emissions Inventory) emissions: https://github.com/NCAR/IPT/tree/master/Emissions/EPA_Anthropgenic


## Meteorological Data Regridding

Regrid MERRA2 meteorological reanalyses: https://github.com/NCAR/IPT/tree/master/Meterological_Reanalysis_Data


## Initial Conditions Regridding

Regrid atmospheric initial condition files: https://github.com/NCAR/IPT/tree/master/Initial_conditions
