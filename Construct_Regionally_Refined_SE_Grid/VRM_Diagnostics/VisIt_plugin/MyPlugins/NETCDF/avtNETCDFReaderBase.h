// Class: avtNETCDFReaderBase
//
// Purpose:
//   This class is a base class for "Reader" classes. which I mean to distinguish
//   as the class that does the actual NETCDF reading. The various FileFormat 
//   classes call a reader to do their work. There are MTSD and STSD versions
//   of the FileFormat which call the same reader class. This permits the plugin 
//   to serve up the best avtFileFormatInterface for the data with respect to 
//   whether it is "MT" or "ST". Thus, the FileFormat classes become a very
//   thin veneer on top of the Reader class. We do this mostly to work around a
//   file grouping issue in avtDatabase where it can't group MT files. The other
//   reason is that we don't want to have an ST or MT file format because we
//   don't know which it is until the file is opened.
