 Environment Variable the must be set:
-----------------------------------------

setenv VRM_CESM_TAG  = "/path/to/cesm/tag/"
setenv VRM_REPO_PATH = "/path/to/my/repo/"
setenv VRM_GRID_TAG  = "NEWGRIDNAME_neZZxRR"
setenv VRM_GRID_NAME = "ne0np4.NEWGRIDNAME.neZZxRR"
setenv VRM_GRID_NCOL = "NNNNNN"
setenv VRM_DATE      = "YYMMDD"


These environment variables are used to generate scripts to 
create and install a new VRM grid. In each of the gen_*** 
and Install_grid directories there is a MAKE_* script. Once the
environment variables are set, the user needs to cd the each 
directory and run this script, which will generate the needed 
shell and ncl programs. After reviewing the generated scripts
to ensure that the VRM grid values have been set correctly, the
user just needs to submit/run the scripts and verify that they 
completed successfully. 

VRM_CESM_TAG:  Path to the CESM tag in which the needed CAM/CLM tools have ben compiled.
